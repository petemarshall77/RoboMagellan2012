================

This is the code for the PVIT (http://pvit.org) RoboMagellan robot for
the 2012 competition.

We can't afford a lawyer so have at it if you are interested. Remember
that a lot of this code is specific to the physical characteristics of
our robot but we'll do our best to isolate the overall control
algorithms from the specific implamentations.
